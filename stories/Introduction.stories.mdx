<h1>Abtion Component Library</h1>

The Abtion Component Library is a collection of React components which can be used across a variety of stacks that we use in Abtion.

The components are meant to serve as example code that can be either used 1:1 or tweaked to fit the project at hand.

<h2>Categorization</h2>

<h3>Design System:</h3>
Components from [Abtion's Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/GltSa6wywdjEYrW6hzhi61/Abtion-Designsystem?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

Some of these are ðŸš§ (work in progress). It is a reminder that they don't yet fully implement all the styling from the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GltSa6wywdjEYrW6hzhi61/Abtion-Designsystem?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design" target="_BLANK">design system</a>.

<h3>Toolbox</h3>
Could be any component which might be useful across projects, some of these might
end up in the design system, but that is not necessarily the goal. These can be wrappers
around external libraries.

<h3>External libraries</h3>
Components from external libraries that we know to be battle tested, but for which
we do not have wrapper components.

<h3>Compositions</h3>

Examples of how components and tailwind classes can be used to create compositions like input groups, dropdowns, etc.
