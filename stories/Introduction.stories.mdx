<h1>Abtion Component Library</h1>

The Abtion Component Library is a collection of React components which can be used across a variety of stacks that we use in Abtion.

The components are meant to serve as example code that can be either used 1:1 or tweaked to fit the project at hand.

<h2>Grouping</h2>
Components/examples are grouped into meaningful folders

<h3>Design System:</h3>
Components from [Abtion's Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/GltSa6wywdjEYrW6hzhi61/Abtion-Designsystem?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

Some of these are ðŸš§ (work in progress). It is a reminder that they do not yet fully implement all the styling from the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GltSa6wywdjEYrW6hzhi61/Abtion-Designsystem?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design" target="_BLANK">design system</a>

<h3>Toolbox</h3>
Could be any component which might be useful across projects, some of these might
end up in the design system, but that is not necessarily the goal.

<h3>Examples</h3>
Examples of common compositions.
