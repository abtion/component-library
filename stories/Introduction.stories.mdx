<h1>Abtion Component Library</h1>

The Abtion Component Library is a collection react components which can be used across a variety of stacks that we use in Abtion.

The components are meant to serve as example code that can be either used 1:1 or tweaked to fit the project at hand.

Buttons, alerts and similar "basic" components follow <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GltSa6wywdjEYrW6hzhi61/Abtion-Designsystem?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design" target="_BLANK">Abtion's Design System</a>. These components should be very easy to drop into template-based projects. Other components might require more work.

The library is however meant to be useful rather than perfect. Components are not meant to eventually follow the design guidelines, the goal is for them to be useful.

This Storybook - known as <b>Muffibook</b> - showcases and documents each component.

<h2>Component stages (legend)</h2>

Components are prefixed with an emoji which represents the state of the
component:

- âœ…: Complete: Well-tested and aligned with <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GltSa6wywdjEYrW6hzhi61/Abtion-Designsystem?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design" target="_BLANK">Abtion's Design System</a>.
- ðŸš§: In progress: Meant to become a âœ…, but not entirely done yet.
- ðŸ”Ž: Experimental: Could be any component which might be useful across projects. These might become âœ…'s over time, but it's not a requirement.

As the library is meant to be useful rather than perfect, it's not important that components will eventually become "complete".
